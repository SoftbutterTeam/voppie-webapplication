# Voppie / Comptine
Voppie - a viynl-mix collection social network and store. Primarily, users can create themed viynl-mixs which can then be created on purchase.
- docuement: [voppie-project-description](https://www.craft.do/s/KWR6k5PdPfEBgt)

Comptine - a genesis point for projects requiring basic authentication, user profile features and solid server-client architecture. A solid, clean foundation for qaulity projects to branch from.
- note: this is only the first milestone for voppie, as would be any project. once compelete will be taken to its own repo.

Stack technologies: React-ts, Tailwind, Express-ts, Firebase, Strapio
(my prefered stack - finally getting a clean demonstration of it all)

# Highlights so far
- With this project the focus is first clean qaulity architechture, aiming to set a better standard and put together all that has been learnt. 
- Even the repo, the branches naming and organisation has seen improvements.
